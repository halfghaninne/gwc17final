                This page is about how you can intervene with the bullying or what
                to do if you get bullied. There are many ways to intervene without 
                anyone getting hurt. You can make sure the person who is getting 
                bullied is ok or fine because a lot of people are bystanders and 
                they don’t know what to do. We made this website so you can know 
                what to do if this ever happens again. When you are done reading 
                the paragraphs down below, there will be links to the websites 
                in each paragraph.
