        <p><a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a> is a 
        national non-profit organization working to close the gender gap in 
        technology by providing a unique educational experience for young women 
        to learn computer science.</p>
        <p>Our group met at <a href="http://www.dospace.org/">Do Space</a> -- a 
        first-of-it's-kind tech library in Omaha -- for 26 sessions where we 
        learned about women in technology, coding fundamentals, and project planning.</p>

            <p>I am in the 6th grade. I really like basketball, 
            track, and a lot of other sports. I really didn't know how to code and I
            wanted to learn what it was and how to do it. I think Girls Who Code is 
            very important because a lot of girls drift away from STEM projects 
            (I don't know why -- they're so fun). I think it's great that we are 
            building this  website to help people to stop getting bullied or 
            stop it from starting.</p>

            <p>I am in the 7th grade. I decided to get into coding
            when I was called up to the teachers desk because I was one of the only 
            people with the "computer smarts". I saw that someone was hacking the 
            computers' input, and changing the grades for that specific course. 
            It took me awhile to realize this, but when I did they were saying that 
            they had to restart the computer. I told them not to do this because 
            someone was hacking into the grade input software, and turning off the 
            machine risked deletion or masking of the footprint that this person was
            leaving behind. Eventually the person was caught. Some of my hobbies 
            include: video gaming, coding, and dog training.</p>

            <p>I'm in 6th grade and love to play video games. I think that bullying
            is a subject most people don't think too hard about, you tell an adult
            if someone is being mean, but actually it's more complex than that. 
            Girls Who Code is important because it can help people learn about 
            coding and you get to help the community by building websites that 
            can be useful. I got into Girls Who Code and coding in general because
            I love video games and wanted to know how they were made and how to 
            animate.</p>

            <p>I'm an 11-year-old sixth grader, and I love coding!! I love 
            creating things using code, and I also love reading, writing, and 
            drawing. When I started Girls Who Code, I wanted to code a website 
            and help stop bullying, and GWC has helped me reach my goal. I want 
            to help bring an end to bullying because when it happens to you, you
            feel like the worst person in the world,and I don't want anyone else
            to feel that way. I feel like sharing bullying stories will help 
            people feel better about being bullied. </p>

            <p>I'm one of the members in a great group of girls in 
            Girls Who Code. I'm in the eighth grade and I love coding. Coding is a 
            great thing in life in my opinion. Coding makes up some of the ways we 
            live and I find it very interesting how code can operate many things 
            you may see around you. Being a part of this group has opened up my eyes
            to coding and its showed me it is way more then I thought. Before, going
            into this group I did coding in games in my school but now, I know so 
            much more then I did. This website I made with others is very important 
            to me because it is a topic I like to talk about and it is something that
            we know needs to be fixed EVERYWHERE in the world. I'm happy to be in a 
            group who has girls like me who want to make a difference and show that 
            not only guys can code.</p>

                <p>I'm in 6th grade and this is my first year at Girls Who Code.
                I joined Girls Who Code because I liked the coding activities at
                school and wanted to learn more. Girls Who Code is important to 
                me because I think our project is for a good cause, I learned a 
                lot from it, and met a lot of new people. Some of my hobbies are
                tennis, swimming, cooking, and art.</p>

                <p>I'm a 7th grader who likes playing tennis, reading, and being
                around nature. I got into coding because I've just always 
                been interested in robots and what makes them work. I like helping 
                people, and want to get a job where I am helping people every day :)</p>

                <p>I'm an 8th grader, and the only one in our group who has been
                in the group before (it's my second time). I got into coding by taking
                an HTML class, and I really liked it. Aside from computer science, I
                love art, writing, music, and swimming, though I think I might go
                into computer science as a career.  </p>
